# flippy framey

Efficiently load and display images in the classic flipbook style.

## Description

We wanted to be able to build web pages that featured animations in the classic [flipbook style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UocF4ycBnYE) which could be driven by [scroll position](https://github.com/WilliamsNY/rolly-scrolly), or feasibly some other incrementor/decrementor.


## Features

* Animates through a set of images by rendering them on an HTML5 canvas
* Loads lower quality images and upgrades to high quality versions if the animation is paused

## Usage

```Javascript
flippyFramey({
	/* WIP */
});
```
